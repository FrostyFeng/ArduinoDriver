# ArduinoLibCSharp
ArduinoLibCSharp is a comprehensive library for controlling an Arduino (UNO) board directly through a serial USB connection from C# / Visual Studio. Among other things, his project includes code to upload compiled HEX files to the Arduino directly (which enables auto-bootstrap for these libraries, e.g. no manual sketch upload is required).
