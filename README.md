# ArduinoDriver

A library to easily connect, drive (and debug) an Arduino from within Visual Studio (through a highly syntax compatible implementation running over the serial connection - at high speed).

> *Compatibility note: This library has only been tested with UNO based Arduino boards. It is expected that tweaking of hardware constants in the STK-500 bootloader communication is required in order to support other architectures.*
